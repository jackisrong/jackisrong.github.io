	<p>Notes (recommended to read before using):</p>
	<ul>
		<li>If a drop down is empty, then you likely have not picked something from the previous drop down. After selecting an
		option from a drop down menu, please wait a second for the next drop down to update. If the next drop down does not
		populate, try refreshing the page.</li>
		
		<li>This service was developed using the newest version of Google Chrome. There is no guarantee that this will work with
		other browsers. This service uses JavaScript. Please ensure JavaScript is enabled.</li>
	
		<li>This currently <b>only supports lecture sections</b> with section numbers that are all digits. Lab, tutorial, and
		other sections will not be displayed. Some courses (such as ENGL 112 that use a number number letter section numbering scheme)
		will also not work (sorry, might fix if there's popular demand).</li>

		<li>This services uses the UBC Courses API found at https://ubc-courses-api.herokuapp.com/</li>
		
		<li>I know this website looks terrible. Feel free to clone the GitHub repo, edit the CSS, and email me.</li>
